# T-017: Add command timing and edit summaries to reports

Type: `implementation`

## Goal

Add command timing and edit summaries to reports

## Requirements

- No accepted requirement attached; this is a discovery-style task.

## Source Sections

- None

## Accepted Assumptions

- `A-001` The first AgentSpec release is local-first and CLI-first.
- `A-002` The MVP stores structured .yml artifacts as YAML-compatible JSON to avoid runtime dependencies.

## Allowed Paths

- `docs/**`
- `tests/`
- `src/**/*.py`
- `tests/**/*.py`
- `examples/**/*.json`
- `TRACE_SCHEMA.md`
- `PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `HANDOFF.md`
- `agent/**`

## Allowed Paths Provenance

| Path | Provenance |
|---|---|
| `docs/**` | pattern; fallback scope |
| `tests/` | confirmed; task verification |

## Forbidden Paths

- Anything outside the allowed paths unless the task is explicitly revised.
- If verification needs examples, scripts, fixtures, or bookkeeping not listed above, revise Allowed Paths before execution.

## Tests To Add Or Update

- `tests/`
